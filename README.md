# Optimizing DCGAN for Emoji Generation on Small Datasets

This project improves DCGAN training on a small emoji dataset (~600 images) using spectral normalization, historical averaging, and self-attention.  
We also apply label smoothing, noise injection, and data augmentation to stabilize training and enhance image quality.  
Final outputs demonstrate more consistent and diverse emoji generation.  
See `train.py` to start training and `generated_images/` for output samples.
